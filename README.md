**Kevin's Personal CS Website!**

Hi there! This is a personal web-development project I'm currently working on to learn about Full-Stack Web Development on Github. I'll be using standard HTML, CSS, and Javascript languages to create a page that showcases my projects as well as my resume.


I'm using this tutorial to learn HTML individually: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUMe1FH4CHE

I'll also be using the same Author's tutorial on CSS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4R2E7O-Ngo
